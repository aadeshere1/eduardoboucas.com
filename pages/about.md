Hello, fellow passenger of this incredible ride that is web development. I've been building websites since the turn of the century â€“ I like to think that I've got the hang of it, but the content published here will most certainly indicate otherwise. You're reading *Build Times*, my modest collection of thoughts, experiments, ramblings and rants about the daily goings-on of an individual who gets paid to write gibberish at the computer (but the rants are on the house).

I work at [Stackbit](https://stackbit.com) and I maintain several [open-source projects](https://github.com/eduardoboucas). I also [tweet](https://twitter.com/eduardoboucas) and occasionally [speak](https://speakerdeck.com/eduardoboucas).

This site is fully static and it's built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/). The current homepage design was heavily inspired by a Codepen from [Silke V](https://codepen.io/silkine). The full source code is publicly available and you're free to copy and reuse it as you see fit. Thanks for reading. <!--tomb-->
